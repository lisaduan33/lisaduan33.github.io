      <h1> Overview </h1>
<br>
      <p id=overview_p class="lead">
          Throughout the 20th century, Irish food was considered somewhat conservative. This can be attributed to the Great Famine, when the starving resorted to "foods of the wild." Known as 'famine food', there became a great reluctance to eat them as they often stirred memories of suffering and starvation. As a result, a good plain meal consisting of a trio of meat, vegetables and potatoes became the symbol of comfort in Ireland. This symbol lasted until the 1960s as Ireland began to prosper economically. Many experienced an exciting diversity in foods as overseas travel became popular. Today, a visit to any Irish supermarket and you will see the multicultural influence in Irish food. Examples of Irish cuisine are Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, and soda bread. Ireland is famous for the Irish breakfast, a fried (or grilled) meal generally comprising bacon, egg, sausage, black and white pudding, fried tomato and which may also include fried potato farls or fried potato slices. In the 21st century the usual modern selection of foods common to Western culture has been adopted in Ireland. Europe's dishes have influenced the country, along with other world dishes introduced in a similar fashion to the rest of the western world. In tandem with these developments, the last quarter of the 20th century saw the emergence of a new Irish cuisine based on traditional ingredients handled in new ways.

    <h2> Donal Skehan's Irish Stew </h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h4> What is Irish Stew? </h4>
<br>
        <p>
          Irish stew is a celebrated Irish dish. Although modern Irish stew is generally made with beef or lamb, early versions were usually made with mutton, as it was more widely available. The ingredients are boiled and simmered slowly for up to two hours.

            <li>2 tbsp rapeseed oil
            <li>1kg lamb shoulder, trimmed and cut into 2.5cm chunks
            <li>2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped
            <li>3 celery stalks, trimmed and sliced
            <li>1 bay leaf

          <h5> Method </h5>
<br>
          <ol id="Method">
            <li>Place a large, flameproof casserole pot over a high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and brown the lamb pieces in two batches. Remove and set aside on a plate. Reduce the heat to medium–high, add another tablespoon of oil and fry the onion, celery and carrot for 4–6 minutes or until the onions have softened.
            <li>Preheat the oven to 160°C /325°F/Gas Mark 3.
            <li>Return the meat to the pot, along with the bay leaf and stock, season with sea salt and ground black pepper and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and push the slices of potato down into and across the top of the stew, dot with a little butter and give a final seasoning of sea salt and ground black pepper. Cover and place in the oven to cook for about 1½ hours or until the meat is tender, then remove the lid and cook for a further 10 minutes until the potatoes have coloured.
            <li>You can serve the stew straight away or leave it covered overnight in the fridge for the flavours to develop. Serve in deep bowls with slices of white bread to soak up the liquid.

    <h2> Donal Skehan's Chocolate Guinness Cake </h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h4> What is Chocolate Guinness Cake? </h4>
<br>
      <p>
        If you are a fan of decadent treats, this Chocolate Guinness Cake is the dessert for you! The dense and fudgy sponge has an intense malty flavour which comes from the addition of the stout and is topped with a creamy, white chocolate, cream cheese frosting which some say helps the finished cake resemble a pint of Guinness!

<br>
                  <h5> Method </h5>
<br>
          <ol id="Method">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/ Gas Mark 4, grease a 23cm/ 9 inch cake tin with a removable base and line with a disc of parchment paper. Melt the butter in a saucepan and then whisk in the cocoa powder and Guinness. Remove from the heat and set aside.
            <li>In a large mixing bowl combine the flour, baking soda and sugar. Make a well with the back of a spoon and pour in the melted butter mixture along with the eggs, sour cream and vanilla extract. Pour into the prepared cake tin and place in the oven for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted comes out completely clean. When the cake is baking, make the cream cheese frosting.
            <li>To make the frosting, melt the chocolate in a bowl placed on top of a saucepan filled with a little water boiling over a low heat. Remove from the heat to cool for about 10 minutes. Place the butter and cream cheese in a bowl and beat until fluffy and combined. Mix through the melted white chocolate and then gradually sift and beat in the icing sugar until you have a smooth, spreadable mixture. To assemble the cake, place it on a cake stand and spread with frosting.
